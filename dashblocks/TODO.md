# DashBlocks TODO


## Event propagation up to dashboard level 

- [X] db-event: generated by all widgets and propagated up to dashboard
- [X] augment db-event with widget id on widget level 
- [ ] Events for chartjs
- [ ] Events for plotly 


##  Dashboards 

- [ ] Overlay - dashboard on top of video, picture, etc - on a boarder & bottom
- [ ] Dynamically generated dashboard based on data. I.e. multiple pie charts. 

##  Test Data

- [ ] Datasets, aggregation lib - use in sample dashboards
- [ ] Time-series sample dataset - i.e. sales over time 

##  Documentation 

- [ ] Self-documenting components - jsdoc ?

##  Pages  

- [x] github pages with doc - vuepress
- [x] [Demo project](https://slanatech.github.io/dashblocks) 


## Issues


## Style, Themes and Colors

- [ ] more color sets 
- [ ] Dark mode support across all widgets
- [ ] Examples of custom theme


## Dashboard widget 
- [ ] Title

 
## Chart Types / Components

### D3
- [ ] Horizon: show values
- [ ] Sankey
- [ ] Sunburst  
- [ ] Showcase dashboard  

### Chart.js
- [x] Showcase dashboard

### Plotly 
- [ ] Showcase dashboard
- [ ] Consider: use more customized bundle ( specific modules ) instead of all-in-one. 
      plotly.js-dist is too big to include in bundle ( ~6M )   
       

### Dygraphs
- [x] Showcase dashboard

### Dashblocks
- [x] Number 
- [x] Percent
- [ ] Multiple values - rows with sparklines
- [ ] Showcase dashboard

### Other
- [ ] Table - goodtable ?
- [ ] Markdown 
- [ ] Showcase dashboard


## Options templates

Create class to manage standard props/options templates for various chart types. 
So instead of specifying all props in dashboard definition always, just refer to 
template name (like DbDygraphs-AreaLine)

Consider making template parameterized, i.e. pass axis name (see plotly props)
